          <p>
          Greetings! I'm a Full Stack Developer and C++ coder, navigating the digital landscape with a strong foundation in Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). Beyond the lines of code, I find solace in crafting poetry that breathes life into words. Whether it's architecting robust systems, optimizing algorithms, or penning down verses, I traverse the realms of logic and creativity. My portfolio reflects this unique intersection, offering a glimpse into the fusion of tech precision and poetic expression. Join me on a journey where the art of coding meets the art of language.          </p>
